# RickRollSniffer

I placed some QR-Codes at my university a.e. in the coffee room to make them believe they could have some of my coffee!
Too dumb that it's just a rick roll.... This here is a sniffer that pings IFTTT (https://ifttt.com) to notify me on my phone if someone got rickrolled!

QR-Code leads to http://coffee.lucienzimmermann.xyz
