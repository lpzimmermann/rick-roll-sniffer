# RickRollSniffer (Just some shenanigans)

I placed some QR-Codes at my university a.e. in the coffee room to make them believe they could have some of my coffee!
Too dumb that it's just a rick roll.... This here is a sniffer that pings IFTTT (https://ifttt.com) to notify me on my phone if someone got rickrolled!

QR-Code leads to http://coffee.lucienzimmermann.xyz, where my sniffer is deployed which redirects it to http://coffee-redirect.lucienzimmermann.xyz where the youtube link is.
